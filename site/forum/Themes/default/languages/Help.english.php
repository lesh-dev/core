	<b>Edit Boards</b><br />
	In this menu you can create/reorder/remove boards, and the categories
	above them. For example, if you had a wide-ranging
	site that offered information on &quot;Sports&quot; and &quot;Cars&quot; and &quot;Music&quot;, these
	would be the top-level Categories you\'d create. Under each of these
	categories you\'d likely want to create hierarchical &quot;sub-categories&quot;,
	or &quot;Boards&quot; for topics within each. It\'s a simple hierarchy, with this structure: <br />
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Sports</b>
			&nbsp;- A &quot;category&quot;
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Baseball</b>
				&nbsp;- A board under the category of &quot;Sports&quot;
			</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Stats</b>
					&nbsp;- A child board under the board of &quot;Baseball&quot;
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li><b>Football</b>
			&nbsp;- A board under the category of &quot;Sports&quot;</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	Categories allow you to break down the board into broad topics (&quot;Cars,
	Sports&quot;), and the &quot;Boards&quot; under them are the actual topics under which
	members can post. A user interested in Pintos
	would post a message under &quot;Cars->Pinto&quot;. Categories allow people to
	quickly find what their interests are: Instead of a &quot;Store&quot; you have
	&quot;Hardware&quot; and &quot;Clothing&quot; stores you can go to. This simplifies your
	search for &quot;pipe joint compound&quot; because you can go to the Hardware
	Store &quot;category&quot; instead of the Clothing Store (where you\'re unlikely
	to find pipe joint compound).<br />
	As noted above, a Board is a key topic underneath a broad category.
	If you want to discuss &quot;Pintos&quot; you\'d go to the &quot;Auto&quot; category and
	jump into the &quot;Pinto&quot; board to post your thoughts in that board.<br />
	Administrative functions for this menu item are to create new boards
	under each category, to reorder them (put &quot;Pinto&quot; behind &quot;Chevy&quot;), or
	to delete the board entirely.';

$helptxt['edit_news'] = '<b>Edit Forum News</b><br />
	This allows you to set the text for news items displayed on the Board Index page.
	Add any item you want (e.g., &quot;Don\'t miss the conference this Tuesday&quot;). Each news item should
	go in a separate box, and they are displayed randomly.';

$helptxt['view_members'] = '
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>View all Members</b><br />
			View all members in the board. You are presented with a hyperlinked list of member names. You may click
			on any of the names to find details of the members (homepage, age, etc.), and as Administrator
			you are able to modify these parameters. You have complete control over members, including the
			ability to delete them from the forum.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Awaiting Approval</b><br />
			This section is only shown if you have enabled admin approval of all new registrations. Anyone who registers to join your
			forum will only become a full member once they have been approved by an admin. The section lists all those members who
			are still awaiting approval, along with their email and IP address. You can choose to either accept or reject (delete)
			any member on the list by checking the box next to the member and choosing the action from the drop-down box at the bottom
			of the screen. When rejecting a member you can choose to delete the member either with or without notifying them of your decision.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Awaiting Activation</b><br />
			This section will only be visible if you have activation of member accounts enabled on the forum. This section will list all
			members who have still not activated their new accounts. From this screen you can choose to either accept, reject or remind
			members with outstanding registrations. As above you can also choose to email the member to inform them of the
			action you have taken.<br /><br />

$helptxt['ban_members'] = '<b>Ban Members</b><br />
	SMF provides the ability to &quot;ban&quot; users, to prevent people who have violated the trust of the board
	by spamming, trolling, etc. This allows you to those users who are detrimental to your forum. As an admin,
	when you view messages, you can see each user\'s IP address used to post at that time. In the ban list,
	you simply type that IP address in, save, and they can no longer post from that location.<br />You can also
	ban people through their email address.';

$helptxt['modsettings'] = '<b>Edit Features and Options</b><br />
	There are several features in this section that can be changed to your preference.  Options for installed mods will generally also appear in here.';

$helptxt['number_format'] = '<b>Number Format</b><br />
	You can use this setting to format the way in which numbers on your forum will be displayed to the user. The format of this setting is:<br />
	<div style="margin-left: 2ex;">1,234.00</div><br />
	Where \',\' is the character used to split up groups of thousands, \'.\' is the character used as the decimal point and the number of zeros dictate the accuracy of roundings.';

$helptxt['time_format'] = '<b>Time Format</b><br />
	You have the power to adjust how the time and date look for yourself. There are a lot of little letters, but it\'s quite simple.
	The conventions follow PHP\'s strftime function and are described as below (more details can be found at <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/function.strftime.php" target="_blank">php.net</a>).<br />
	<br />
	The following characters are recognized in the format string: <br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;%A - full weekday name<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;%b - abbreviated month name<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;%B - full month name<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;%d - day of the month (01 to 31) <br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;%D<b>*</b> - same as %m/%d/%y <br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;%e<b>*</b> - day of the month (1 to 31) <br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;%H - hour using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23) <br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;%I - hour using a 12-hour clock (range 01 to 12) <br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;%m - month as a number (01 to 12) <br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;%p - either &quot;am&quot; or &quot;pm&quot; according to the given time<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;%R<b>*</b> - time in 24 hour notation <br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;%S - second as a decimal number <br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;%T<b>*</b> - current time, equal to %H:%M:%S <br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;%y - 2 digit year (00 to 99) <br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;%Y - 4 digit year<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;%Z - time zone or name or abbreviation <br />

$helptxt['registrations'] = '<b>Registration Management</b><br />
	This section contains all the functions that could be necessary to manage new registrations on the forum. It contains up to four
	sections which are visible depending on your forum settings. These are:<br /><br />
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Register new member</b><br />
			From this screen you can choose to register accounts for new members on their behalf. This can be useful in forums where registration is closed
			to new members, or in cases where the admin wishes to create a test account. If the option to require activation of the account
			is selected the member will be emailed a activation link which must be clicked before they can use the account. Similarly you can
			select to email the users new password to the stated email address.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Edit Registration Agreement</b><br />
			This allows you to set the text for the registration agreement displayed when members sign up for your forum.
			You can add or remove anything from the default registration agreement, which is included in SMF.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Set Reserved Names</b><br />
			Using this interface you can specify words or names which may not be used by your users.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li>

$helptxt['modlog'] = '<b>Moderation Log</b><br />
	This section allows members of the admin team to track all the moderation actions that the forum moderators have performed. To ensure that

	The \'objects\' column lists any variables associated with the action.';
$helptxt['error_log'] = '<b>Error Log</b><br />
	The error log tracks logs every serious error encountered by users using your forum. It lists all of these errors by date which can be sorted
	by clicking the black arrow next to each date. Additionally you can filter the errors by clicking the picture next to each error statistic. This
	allows you to filter, for example, by member. When a filter is active the only results that will be displayed will be those that match that filter.';
$helptxt['theme_settings'] = '<b>Theme Settings</b><br />
	The settings screen allows you to change settings specific to a theme. These settings include options such as the themes directory and URL information but
	also options that affect the layout of a theme on your forum. Most themes will have a variety of user configurable options, allowing you to adapt a theme
	to suit your individual forum needs.';
$helptxt['smileys'] = '<b>Smiley Center</b><br />
	Here you can add and remove smileys, and smiley sets.  Note importantly that if a smiley is in one set, it\'s in all sets - otherwise, it might
